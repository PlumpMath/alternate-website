### Look Ma -- No Stylesheets!

Well, no .css files anyways.  Just trying out some width-sensitive ui's using [forest](https://github.com/mhallin/forest) and [enfocus](https://github.com/ckirkendall/enfocus).  I'm purposefuly avoiding flex-box.

### Trying this out

Download this repo, cd into it and..

```bash
boot dev
```
